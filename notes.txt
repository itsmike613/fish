Create a fishing game with HTML, CSS, JS, and Three.js.

Background (Three.js):
Render an infinite water plane using water.png as the repeating texture (as far as the player can see).
Make the water slightly transparent and animate the texture sliding to simulate movement.
Add 2–3 white seagulls with flapping wings that occasionally fly around.

Main Page:
Show a minimalist card with:
Top-left label: fish (game name)
Top-right label: current in-game time
Include a “Fish” button with a progress bar visually attached to the bottom edge of the button (like a bottom border / built-in strip, not a separate element floating under it). The bar is empty by default.

On click:
Change the button text to “Reel In”.
Run the progress bar for a random duration between 2–6 seconds.
If the player presses Reel In too early, show an error toast: “Too quick!”
When the timer finishes, the player has 2 seconds to press Reel In:
If they succeed, they catch an item.
If they fail, show “The fish escaped!” and reset the button to “Fish”.

Backpack (Inventory):
Press E to hide all page content and open the backpack modal.
Backpack layout: 5 rows × 9 slots, Minecraft-style:
Click to pick up/move items.
Shift-click to quick-move.
Press E again to close the backpack and return to fishing.
Hovering an item shows an info panel below the backpack (name, description, price, etc.).
The backpack modal must not resize or shift when the info panel appears.
Slots should be square, roughly Minecraft-sized.

Toasts:
Toasts appear top-center of the screen.
Format: "[icon] message"
Successful catch: item icon on the left + You caught xN [itemname]!
Missed 2-second window: icon ./Source/Assets/Icons/error.png + The fish escaped!
Reeled too early: icon ./Source/Assets/Icons/error.png + Too quick!

24-Minute In-Game Time System:
1 real minute = 1 in-game hour
1 real second = 2.5 in-game minutes
11:00 PM = exactly 23 minutes into the 24-minute loop
Visually sync the Three.js environment to the clock with four stages:
Starry Night, glowing Sunrise, bright Day, atmospheric Sunset
Lighting/sky colors must stay perfectly synced to match fish “time catchable” windows.

Lore System:
On demand, compute total fish caught by summing all values in the catches object in Local Storage (C + U + R + E + L, across categories).
When the total equals a lore entry’s ctch, award that lore item instead of normal loot.
Lore items must be earned in linear table order (no skipping).

Lore UI & Interaction:
Toasts and backpack icons use the lore icon from Catches/Lore/...
Right-click a lore item in the backpack to:
Hide all UI and display its image from Catches/Files/... centered on screen.
Exit the image view with ESC, E, or clicking anywhere (returns to backpack).

Fishing Loot Rules:
On a successful catch, increment Local Storage for the caught item type (category + rarity).
Loot must be filtered by:
Current in-game hour vs. the item’s time ranges
Rarity-based roll chances

Naming:
Keep IDs/classes/variables short (e.g., "fishing" instead of "fishingCard").

UI Style:
Minimalist, modern, no excessive padding.
Ensure everything fits on screen, including backpack + hover info panel.
Use Google Font: Jersey 10 for all text.

Local Storage Schema:
Store catch counts by category and rarity:
{
  "lore": 0,
  "fish": { "C": 0, "U": 0, "R": 0, "E": 0, "L": 0 },
  "junk": { "C": 0, "U": 0, "R": 0, "E": 0, "L": 0 },
  "treasure": { "C": 0, "U": 0, "R": 0, "E": 0, "L": 0 }
}
Total catches = sum of all rarity buckets across fish, junk, and treasure.
