Create a fishing game UI (not the game, just the UI) using HTML, CSS, JS, Three.JS.
Make it so it works on mobile, desktop, and all other device types.

Background:
The background of the entire website should be water using water.png for infinity, as far as the player can see, using Three.JS.
Make the water slightly transparent, and "moving" sliding animation to make it feel more immersive.
Add flying seagulls (white with flapping wings) flying around a couple (2-3) occasionally.

Main Page Content:
Create a card with a button on it that says "Fish", on the bottom of the button add a progress bar, by default it is empty.
When I make the game functional, I want the Fish button to become disabled after pressing it, change the button text to "Reel In", and make the progress bar last 2-6 seconds.
After that time is up, the player needs to press "Reel In" within 2 seconds. or they lose the fish and the button goes back to "Fish" state. (This adds difficulty, by giving only two seconds to reel in the fish)

Inventory Page:
Pressing (E) on computer or pressing the (Inventory) button on computer/mobile, hides all the content on the page (fishing card, etc.)
It opens the inventory modal, 5 rows of 9 slots. Just like the Minecraft inventory, shift click to quick move, click to pickup/move, etc.
Pressing (E) again or pressing the button below the inventory modal closes the inventory modal and goes back to the home page (fishing)

Toast Structure:
"[icon] _message_"

Toasts:
Catching an item from Reel In button will show a toast that has the item they caught on the left (icon), then the message "You caught xN [itemname]!"
Failing to catch within two seconds will make the toast icon "fishingcatcherror.png" with the message "The fish escaped!"
