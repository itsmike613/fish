Without Game
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a fishing game UI (not the game, just the UI) using HTML, CSS, JS, Three.JS.
Make it so it works on mobile, desktop, and all other device types.

Background:
The background of the entire website should be water using water.png for infinity, as far as the player can see, using Three.JS.
Make the water slightly transparent, and "moving" sliding animation to make it feel more immersive.
Add flying seagulls (white with flapping wings) flying around a couple (2-3) occasionally.

Main Page Content:
Create a card with a button on it that says "Fish", on the bottom of the button add a progress bar, by default it is empty.
When I make the game functional, I want the Fish button to become disabled after pressing it, change the button text to "Reel In", and make the progress bar last 2-6 seconds.
After that time is up, the player needs to press "Reel In" within 2 seconds. or they lose the fish and the button goes back to "Fish" state. (This adds difficulty, by giving only two seconds to reel in the fish)

Inventory Page:
Pressing (E) on computer or pressing the (Inventory) button on computer/mobile, hides all the content on the page (fishing card, etc.)
It opens the inventory modal, 5 rows of 9 slots. Just like the Minecraft inventory, shift click to quick move, click to pickup/move, etc.
Pressing (E) again or pressing the button below the inventory modal closes the inventory modal and goes back to the home page (fishing)

Toast Structure:
"[icon] _message_"

Toasts:
Catching an item from Reel In button will show a toast that has the item they caught on the left (icon), then the message "You caught xN [itemname]!"
Failing to catch within two seconds will make the toast icon "fishingcatcherror.png" with the message "The fish escaped!"

Pressing (E) again closes the inventory modal and goes back to the home page (fishing)
Hovering over an item (with mouse) will display a modal under the inventory menu, this modal should have info on the current item being hovered, such as the name, description, price, and everything else.

Toast Structure:
"[icon] _message_"

Toasts:
Catching an item from Reel In button will show a toast that has the item they caught on the left (icon), then the message "You caught xN [itemname]!"
Failing to catch within two seconds will make the toast icon "fish/Source/Assets/Icons/error.png" with the message "The fish escaped!"

The 24-Minute Logic:
1 Real Minute = 1 In-game Hour
1 Real Second = 2.5 In-game Minutes
11:00 PM = Exactly 23 minutes into the loop.
Have the Three.JS background visually transition through the four stages of a day: a dark, star-filled Night, a vibrant glowing Sunrise, a bright clear Daytime, and a deep atmospheric Sunset. The lighting and sky color must stay perfectly synced with the 24-minute clock so the environment matches the "Time Catchable" stats of the fish.

Lore System:
Track a single total variable in Local Storage. When "total" matches a "ctch" number in the lore table, the player catches that specific lore item instead of regular loot. Items must be caught in the table's linear order.
Lore System UI & Interaction:
Toasts/Inventory Item Icons: Use the icon from Catches/Lore/....
Right-Clicking on a lore item in the inventory: Hide all menus and display the image from Catches/Files/... corresponding to the lore item right clicked, in the center of the screen.
Exit: Pressing ESC, E, or clicking anywhere closes the image and re-opens the inventory.
The player catches 1 lore item every time the "total" variable reaches a milestone defined in the lore table's ctch property.

Local Storage Variables:
"total" = The total amount of fish/junk/treasure/lore items caught
"fishC" = Total Common fish caught
"fishU" = Total Uncommon fish caught
"fishR" = Total Rare fish caught
"fishE" = Total Epic fish caught
"fishL" = Total Legendary fish caught
"junkC" = Total Common junk caught
"junkU" = Total Uncommon junk caught
"junkR" = Total Rare junk caught
